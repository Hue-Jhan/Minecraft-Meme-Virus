The video does not contain any volume because github won't allow embedding audio in mp4 file, however you can find the video with audio in the Media folder.

# ðŸ’» Code

This simple code first extracts the resources from the exe to the current folder, sets a custom wallpaper, maxes out the volume, blocks some incoming keyboard inputs like closing events, then spams annoying messageboxes and finally opens multiple videos of CHICKEN JOKEY!!! The videos have been modified so that the volume is already as high as possible (earrape kind of videos). I am steve. The code also moves the mouse a little.
